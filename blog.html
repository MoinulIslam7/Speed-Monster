      <h2 class="text-center">Local Storage vs Session Storage</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that with
        sessionStorage, the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With localStorage, the data is
        persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data. </p>
      <h4>Local Storage: </h4>
      <p>Local storage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or
        the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.</p>
      <h4>Session Storage: </h4>
      <p>Session Storage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser
        is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">Global Scope vs Block Scope</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
        controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and
        the like.</p>
      <h4>Global Scope: </h4>
      <p> Global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default. This scope includes
        all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer.
        Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.</p>
      <h4>Block Scope: </h4>
      <p> A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the
        block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be available outside the block
        even if the block is inside a function.</p>

      <h1 class="text-center ">How Javascript Event loop works?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting
        and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other
        languages like C and Java.<br>When the Web API finishes executing the task, it doesn’t just push it back to the
        Call Stack automatically. It goes to the Task Queue. A queue is a data structure that works on the First in
        First out principle, so as tasks get pushed into the
        queue, they get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s, which are being pushed
        to the Task Queue, then go back to the Call Stack to get their result printed out.
        <br>
        The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task
        Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for
        available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear
        again, and repeats the same process.

      <h2 class="text-center">Explain undefined in JavaScript?</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
      <h4>Following are the Undefined in JavaScript: </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>variable that is not initialized will give undefined.</li>
        <li>function with no return.</li>
        <li>parameter that is not passed will be undefined.</li>
        <li>if return has nothing no the right side will return undefined.</li>
        <li>property doesn't exists on an objectwill give you undefined.</li>
        <li>accessing array elements outside of the index range undefined.</li>
        <li>deleting an element inside an array undefined.</li>
        <li>sat a value directly to undefined.</li>
      </ul>
